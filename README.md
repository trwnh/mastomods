# styles
CSS tweaks and custom themes for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), a libre micro-blogging social server whose default web frontend is similar to Tweetdeck. 

# Instructions for admins
Download this repo and copy the files into your Mastodon deployment at `app/javascript/styles`. If I can figure out the git commands to fetch the files without messing up your existing Mastodon deployment, I'll add them here.

# Instructions for users
Copy and paste desired CSS tweaks into your user-style manager. If you don't have one, use Stylus:

# Other info
This work is heavily based on (and an extension of) my earlier work on [Mastodon Flat CSS](https://github.com/trwnh/mastodon-flat-css), and its child theme [Linernotes Mastodon Themes](https://github.com/trwnh/linernotes_mastodon_themes). I grew tired of having to maintain what was essentially the same code in multiple different places, so this repo was created to be a more modular way of managing code snippets after I learned enough about how importing works.

You may contact me or follow me at [mastodon.social/@trwnh](https://mastodon.social/@trwnh) if you need any help or have any questions about this project. You may also message me via XMPP/email (a@trwnh.com) if you wish.
