# About this repo
This repo contains CSS tweaks and modifications for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), a libre micro-blogging social server whose default web frontend is similar to Tweetdeck. These mods can be used to create custom themes by admins for their Mastodon instances, or imported into userstyle extensions by users.

# Instructions for admins
Download this repo and copy the files into your Mastodon deployment at `app/javascript/styles`. If I can figure out the git commands to fetch the files without messing up your existing Mastodon deployment, I'll add them here.

# Instructions for users
Copy and paste desired CSS tweaks into your user-style manager. If you don't have one, use Stylus:

![mfc preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trwnh/mastodon-flat-css/master/mfc.png) | This work is heavily based on (and an extension of) my earlier work on [Mastodon Flat CSS](https://github.com/trwnh/mastodon-flat-css), and its child theme [Linernotes Mastodon Themes](https://github.com/trwnh/linernotes_mastodon_themes). I grew tired of having to maintain what was essentially the same code in multiple different places, so this repo was created to be a more modular way of managing code snippets after I learned enough about how importing works.
